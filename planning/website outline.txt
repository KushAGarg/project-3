GOALS:

10/12
- Clean the data, make sure the data is maleable, jsonifiable, and that the data types are ideal.
- House the data in PostgreSQL server
- Outline the website

FIRST, TREAT IT ALL AS ONE WEBPAGE BEFORE ADDING NAV BAR & PAGES

Pages:
- Home (index.html)
    - Interactive map of UFO sightings (using Leaflet)
- Analysis
    - Data visualizations (charts, graphs, using Plotly)
- Data
    - Dataframe heads, which will have to be translated from Pandas DF to HTML Table
- API
    - will need workable routes that mean you put in an ID number and it spits out the JSONified entry

Needs:
- HTML files for each page
- JS files for each page (ugh)
- ONE CSS file...
