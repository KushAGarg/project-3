GOALS:

10/12
- Clean the data, make sure the data is maleable, jsonifiable, and that the data types are ideal.
- House the data in PostgreSQL server
- Outline the website

FIRST, TREAT IT ALL AS ONE WEBPAGE BEFORE ADDING NAV BAR & PAGES

Pages:
- Home (index.html)
    - Interactive map of UFO sightings (using Leaflet)
- Analysis
    - Data visualizations (charts, graphs, using Plotly)
- Data
    - Dataframe heads, which will have to be translated from Pandas DF to HTML Table
- API
    - will need workable routes that mean you put in an ID number and it spits out the JSONified entry

Needs:
- HTML files for each page
- JS files for each page (ugh)
- ONE CSS file...

TO DO (10/18)
- Person 1: Clean up & find anomalies (extrema) in the data. Additionally, this person can expand on the vision of the
            project (how do we make it more interactive? What could we do to decorate the website? (CSS knowledge
            not required) What still needs to be done?)
- Person 2: Flask app and Leaflet map. I will have to consult with Eli as to why I am having an error. Given that the map
            is our homepage, this is a necessary step.
- Person 3: Visualizations. Consider the proposal and the plotly (belly-button) assignment we did. Consult with group.
            We will need visualizations to fulfill the requirements. Time to get creative and start working.
- Person 4: Construct the HTML/CSS that will be necessary for website to function. This includes getting the nav bar 
            to traverse different html files (This is not as intimidating as it seems!). This includes making table elements
            on the Data tab where we will populate it with the dataframes (also a good learning moment!).

# Scatter plot of duration? Find extrema.
# Visualizations include dropdown by state and that populates metadata and top cities in the state by sightings.
# Figure out when we can dedicate time this weekend to the project.
