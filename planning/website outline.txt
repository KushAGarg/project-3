GOALS:

10/12
- Clean the data, make sure the data is maleable, jsonifiable, and that the data types are ideal.
- House the data in PostgreSQL server
- Outline the website

FIRST, TREAT IT ALL AS ONE WEBPAGE BEFORE ADDING NAV BAR & PAGES

Pages:
- Home (index.html)
    - Interactive map of UFO sightings (using Leaflet)
- Analysis
    - Data visualizations (charts, graphs, using Plotly)
- Data
    - Dataframe heads, which will have to be translated from Pandas DF to HTML Table
- API
    - will need workable routes that mean you put in an ID number and it spits out the JSONified entry

Needs:
- HTML files for each page
- JS files for each page (ugh)
- ONE CSS file...

TO DO (10/16)
- Person 1: Clean up the cells, variable names, and add comments to code.
- Person 2: Craft interesting DataFrames from the data. Consider GroupBy, sort_values, and anomalies (extrema) in the data.
- Person 3: Begin constructing the HTML that will be necessary for website to function.
- Person 4: Begin work on the visualizations. Start with a leaflet map that identifies the geographic location of each observation.
